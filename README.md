The data used in this work is generated using numerical simulation in MATLAB, and the codes are released in the "code files."

The data generated corresponds to the binary classification of the dynamical singularities, where the label y = +1 (-1) implies that the system exhibits (does not exhibit) a dynamical singularity. Our data is generated by discretizing the spherical angles theta and phi.

The data is structured with three columns and 40000 rows. The columns are organized as follows: column 1 (theta), column 2 (phi), and column 3 (y = +1, -1).
